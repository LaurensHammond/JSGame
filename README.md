# JSGame
This is a simple game created in JavaScript language.
The aim of it is reminding the structure of JS which 
has not been used by me for a long time and a proof 
of my programming skills.

_Tower of Hanoi_
 
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game that is won 
if the player moves all the disks from one rod to 
the other using the third rod. There are not two disks 
of the same size. The rules are following:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one 
of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or 
on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
